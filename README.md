A few years ago, I tapped into the world of web design, which slowly moved me into the exciting world of UX/UI and now, the process of web development. It's exciting to see myself take an old project that started as a design concept and finally become something I can execute and develop myself.

Introducing Love Baked Wings, a small Vegan-friendly Wing spot in the heart of Los Angeles. I came across this location hoping to order takeout to save my sister and me some time. After realizing that there were no in-house order pickup options, I saw this as a sign of opportunity and began designing.

What started as just an experience, an idea, and finally, a finished product, has now opened up a whole new world of beginnings.
