A few years ago, I tapped into the world of web design, that slowly moved me into the exciting world UX/UI and now, the process of web developement. It's exciting seeing myself take an old project, which started off as an ideation that can fianlly become something I can execute and develop myself.

Introducing Love Baked Wings, a small Vegan friendly Wing spot in the heart of Los Angeles. I came across this location in hopes of ordering takeout to save my sister and I some time. After reviewing that there was no in-house order pickup options, I saw this as a sign of opportunity and began designing.

What started as just an experience, an idea, and finally, a finished product, has now opened up a whole new world of beginnings.
